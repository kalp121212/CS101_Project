## Controls:

Note: Only use keyboard to control the movements of the lasso, pressing the mouse may end up quitting game automatically.

## Basic rules:

1. There are total 5 levels, the aim of each level is to catch the coin within yr lasso.
2. You have 3 lives and 60 seconds for each level, if all your lives are exhausted or the time gets over, the game will display yr final score and end.
3. After the game is over, it will prompt for you to enter your name, this is the name that will be stored in the final leaderboard with your score.
4. Few levels have bombs (which look like coins but are black in colour) in them, beware of them, if you touch a bomb, you will go back to the previous level and lose all yr score earned from that level before. If you hit a bomb more than 3 times, the game will end.
5. The score for each level is calculated using an algorithm which considers the time taken to finish and level and the difficulty of the level into consideration as its major factors.
